- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrapefruitEnjoyer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning game development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a VR game I'm creating in Unity! (Mostly voice acting, even then not much)
- 🍊 I enjoy the common grapefruit. (I don't care if that emoji looks like an orange!)
